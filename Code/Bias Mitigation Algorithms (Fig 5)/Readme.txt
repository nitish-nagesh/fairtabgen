Run the corresponding code to view the results for each dataset.
As discussed in the paper, DeCAF did not adequately capture the label distribution in the Law dataset.
Therefore, for the Law-DeCAF setting, the TR-TS setup (i.e., training on a combination of real and synthetic data, testing on real data) is reported instead of the standard TS-TS configuration.
